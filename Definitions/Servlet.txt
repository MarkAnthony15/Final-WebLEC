CGI vs. Servlet

CGI (Common Gateway Interface)
- enables the web server to call an external program and pass HTTP request information to the external program to process the request.

Used:
- to generate pages dynamically
- perform some other action when someone fills out an HTML form and click the submit button.

How it works:
- A reader sends a URL that causes the AOLserver to use CGI to run the program.

Disadvantages of CGI
- Increasing number of clients will take more time for sending response.
- Starts a process for each request. (Web Server is limited to start a process)
- CGI uses platform dependent language. (C, C++, perl)

	Platform Dependent
		- refers to application that run in only one hardware series with the operating system not being relevant.
